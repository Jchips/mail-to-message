# Project agreement

I am the only person on my team (Jelani R).

## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

- Analytical thinking

How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

- By using them throughout developing the project. I will play to my strengths.

In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

- Confidence

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

What hours will you be available to communicate?

- Afternoons, evenings

What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- Slack

How often will you take breaks?

- As needed

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

- Contact instructor, work harder other days

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

- Slack

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

- I can do this in Notion

What project management tool will be used?

- Notion

## Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.
